# Two-Element-Endfire-array-antenna-using-Hertzian-dipole
This project designs a two-element Hertzian dipole antenna array at 700 MHz for end-fire radiation. Optimized spacing enhances directivity, ensuring reliable line-of-sight communication. The array focuses signal propagation, minimizing interference and extending coverage, making it suitable for wireless and radar applications.
